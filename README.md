# Debootstrap-Kaisen-Argon2id-SecureBoot-Guide
I will demonstrate how to use debootstrap to build Kaisen Linux. While in chroot, I will demonstrate how to compile grub2 with ArchLinux's grub-improved-luks2 that allows me to encrypt the root system with argon2id password hashing algorithm. Lastly, I will demonstrate how to create machine owner key (MOK) to sign grub bootloader and vmlinuz.
